# User Authentication Service - 0x03

## Overview

This project aims to build a complete user authentication service using Python and Flask. The project walks through the steps to understand and implement user authentication mechanisms. For learning purposes, we are not using pre-built modules like Flask-User, but implementing the mechanisms from scratch.

## Resources

Read or watch:
- [Flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
- [Requests module](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
- [HTTP status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Declare API routes in a Flask app
- Get and set cookies
- Retrieve request form data
- Return various HTTP status codes

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.7)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5)
- You should use SQLAlchemy 1.3.x
- All files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All modules should have a documentation string (docstring)
- All classes should have a documentation string (docstring)
- All functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation string (docstring)
- All functions should be type annotated
- The Flask app should only interact with Auth and never with the DB directly
- Only public methods of Auth and DB should be used outside these classes

## Setup

You will need to install `bcrypt`:

```bash
pip3 install bcrypt
```

## Tasks

0. User Model

Create a SQLAlchemy model named User for a database table named users.

Attributes:

    id: integer primary key
    email: non-nullable string
    hashed_password: non-nullable string
    session_id: nullable string
    reset_token: nullable string

1. Create User

Complete the DB class to implement the add_user method. This method should save a user to the database with the given email and hashed_password.

2. Find User

Implement the DB.find_user_by method. This method should return the first row found in the users table as filtered by the methodâ€™s input arguments. Raise NoResultFound and InvalidRequestError appropriately.

3. Update User

Implement the DB.update_user method that updates a user's attributes and commits the changes to the database. Raise a ValueError for invalid arguments.

4. Hash Password

Define a _hash_password method that returns a salted hash of the input password using bcrypt.

5. Register User

Implement the Auth.register_user method. If a user already exists with the provided email, raise a ValueError. Otherwise, hash the password, save the user to the database, and return the User object.

6. Basic Flask App

Set up a basic Flask app with a single GET route ("/") that returns a JSON payload: {"message": "Bienvenue"}.

7. Register User Endpoint

Implement the POST /users route to register a user. Return appropriate JSON payloads for successful registration and already registered emails.

8. Credentials Validation

Implement the Auth.valid_login method to validate email and password.

9. Generate UUIDs

Implement a _generate_uuid function that returns a string representation of a new UUID.

10. Get Session ID

Implement the Auth.create_session method to generate and store a session ID for a user, and return the session ID.

11. Log In

Implement the POST /sessions route to log in a user and set the session ID as a cookie.

12. Find User by Session ID

Implement the Auth.get_user_from_session_id method to find and return the user corresponding to the session ID.

13. Destroy Session

Implement Auth.destroy_session to update the user's session ID to None.

14. Log Out

Implement the DELETE /sessions route to log out a user by destroying their session and redirecting to GET /.

15. User Profile

Implement the GET /profile route to return the user's email if a valid session ID is provided. Return a 403 status code for invalid session IDs or non-existent users.
